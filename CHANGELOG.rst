v0.5.0 - 2019-03-10
-------------------

Added
~~~~~

* Several tests in ``test_predsim.py``.
* A directory, ``test_files/``, for files used by the test suite.


Changed
~~~~~~~

* By default, simulated data is written to standard output (stdout)
  and it is no longer possible to name an output file (but output
  can still be redirected to a file!).
* Records are processed iteratively, and output written after the
  processing of an individual record has been finished.
* Opening and closing input files when using the command-line interface.
* Documentation in ``README.rst``.
